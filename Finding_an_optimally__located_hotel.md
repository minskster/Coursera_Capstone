# Finding an optimally located hotel

## Introduction

Many people like to spend their vacation sightseeing in cities such as Rome, Paris, London, etc. These are huge cities with a large number of attractions.
The first thing a tourist faces: Where is the best place to live to see everything? 

## Business Problem

A vacation and money are not endless! For a week, or even less, I want to see as much as possible and not waste time on unnecessary movements.
Let's create a tool that will help the tourist to suggest hotels from which will be closer to the sights of interest to him.
Key factors in choosing a hotel:
- the location of the hotel is optimal for the desired attractions
- the hotel has free rooms
- the price per room does not exceed the indicated amount 

To simplify the task, we assume that the tourist walks only on foot.
If possible, we will try to solve the problem taking into account the movement by metro and the time for sightseeing.
